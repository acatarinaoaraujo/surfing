<h1>A history of surfing</h1>

<div class="content">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Surfing is an amazing sport with an impressive history. The exact origins of surfing are not certain, but it was first observed by Europeans on a ship in Tahiti back in 1767. Research suggests that surfing dates back to the ancient Polynesian cultures that existed long ago. According to data collected and many myths, the chief of a tribe was the man who could surf the best. In other words, the top wave rider was the top man in his community. That says a lot about how important surfing was in the lives of the ancients. Hawaiian surfing has a rich tradition. The ancient Hawaiian inhabitants looked as surfing as an integral part of life. It was not just a hobby or a job. It was a way of life and an art form for them.</p>
